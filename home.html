    <h2>Why FreshSense?</h2>
    <p>
      FreshSense detects odor signals long before contamination becomes visible.
      This protects harvests, reduces waste, and keeps grow rooms healthier.
    </p>

    <h2>A New Way to Protect Mushroom Farms</h2>
    <p>
      In the world of farming, mushrooms are special. They grow fast, they are healthy, 
      and they are becoming more popular around the world. But mushroom growing also comes 
      with a big problem: they are very sensitive. A small change in their environment 
      can cause mold, bad bacteria, or unwanted smells that can ruin the entire harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      FreshSense uses smell-detection technology paired with smart software to help mushroom 
      farmers protect their crops before anything goes wrong. It turns the natural power of 
      smell into a tool that keeps farms safer, cleaner, and more profitable.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is FreshSense?</h2>
    <p>
      FreshSense is a simple device that “smells” the air inside mushroom farms. It detects 
      unusual odors that may signal problems such as mold, bacteria, or substrate issues. 
      When something is detected, FreshSense sends an alert to the farmer’s phone so action 
      can be taken immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Smell Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Before mold becomes visible or bacteria spreads, they release tiny odor particles. 
      Humans cannot detect these early signals, but FreshSense can. This gives farmers a 
      head start, allowing them to prevent contamination before it becomes harmful.
    </p>

    <h2>How FreshSense Works</h2>
    <h3>1. Smart Odor Sensor</h3>
    <p>
      A small device placed in grow rooms reads the air every second. It checks for odors 
      known to be early signs of trouble.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Mobile App</h3>
    <p>
      The app provides live readings and alerts such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Warning: Possible mold activity in Room 2.”</li>
      <li>“Alert: Air quality changing — check humidity or ventilation.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why FreshSense Is Important</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prevents crop loss by detecting issues early</li>
      <li>Saves money by avoiding ruined harvests</li>
      <li>Reduces stress through constant monitoring</li>
      <li>Improves mushroom quality and consistency</li>
      <li>Works for both small and large farms</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Can Use FreshSense?</h2>
    <p>
      FreshSense is perfect for mushroom farmers growing oyster, shiitake, button, lion’s mane, 
      and more. It also supports indoor farms, vertical farming setups, substrate makers, 
      and new growers.
    </p>

    <h2>A Simple Tool With a Big Impact</h2>
    <p>
      FreshSense helps farms achieve cleaner rooms, fewer outbreaks, and more stable harvests. 
      It acts like an invisible guard watching the environment 24/7.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes FreshSense Different?</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike traditional sensors that only measure temperature and humidity, FreshSense focuses 
      on smell — the earliest sign of contamination. This gives farmers the time needed to act 
      before damage happens.
    </p>

    <h2>Designed With Farmers in Mind</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to install</li>
      <li>Affordable for small farms</li>
      <li>Low maintenance</li>
      <li>Works automatically</li>
      <li>Sends simple, clear alerts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Mission of FreshSense</h2>
    <p>
      FreshSense aims to support farmers, reduce waste, improve food safety, and help mushroom 
      production become more sustainable.
    </p>

    <h2>A Fresh Start for Mushroom Farming</h2>
    <p>
      FreshSense is more than a product — it is a partner for every mushroom grower. By turning 
      smells into information, it gives farmers control, confidence, and protection.
