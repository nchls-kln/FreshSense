        <h3>A New Way to Protect Mushroom Farms</h3>
        <p>
          Mushrooms are sensitive and require a stable environment. Even small
          disruptions can lead to mold, bacteria, or unwanted smells that destroy
          harvests. FreshSense uses advanced odor-detection technology to catch
          these problems early, helping farmers protect their crops before anything
          goes wrong.

      <div class="info-block">
        <h3>What Is FreshSense?</h3>
        <p>
          FreshSense is a smart device that continuously monitors the air in mushroom
          farms. It detects unusual odor patterns associated with mold, bacteria, or
          substrate issues and sends instant alerts to the farmer's mobile app.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="info-grid">
        <div>
          <h3>Why Smell Matters</h3>
          <p>
            Before contamination becomes visible, fungi and bacteria release odor
            particles. Humans can’t detect them, but FreshSense can — giving farmers
            a valuable early warning.
          </p>
